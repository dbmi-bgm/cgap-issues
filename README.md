## Background
The CGAP ecosystem is comprised of many repositories that have been developed over a number of years; for a list of these related repos, refer to the [organization page](https://github.com/dbmi-bgm). With a few small exceptions, most of our source code is available in GitHub repositories with an open source license of some kind. Our goal is to use this repository as a central source for public issue management across all repositories.

Additionally, [the CGAP wiki](https://github.com/dbmi-bgm/cgap-issues/wiki) (currently under development) will be a resource for high-level, cross-repository documentation of the CGAP ecosystem. However, we're very conscious of the fact that there's more to open source than just dumping text into an open source repository. For more information on our current approach to open source and how it relates to the future of CGAP, see [this](https://github.com/dbmi-bgm).
